# randocat - produce a stream of pseudorandom data

## Overview

This script essentially emulates the behavior of running
```
$ cat /dev/random [-u] [ < random seed ]
```
from a Linux host. The entropy is generated by the script itself, for systems that lack a suitable kernel-provided source.

## Usage

```
./randocat
```

## Example

Below example assumes the pipeview (pv) utility has been installed

```
$ ./randocat.py -d | pv > /dev/null
INFO:root:Loaded 2 entropy modules [ProcEntropyGatherer, SockstatEntropyGatherer]
48KiB 0:00:09 [4.01KiB/s] [                                <=> ]
```
