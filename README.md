# randocat - produce a stream of pseudorandom data

## Overview

This script essentially emulates the behavior of running
```
$ cat /dev/random [-u] [ < random seed ]
```
from a Linux host. The entropy is generated by the script itself, for systems that lack a suitable kernel-provided source.

It consists of the following components:
- Entropy gatherer:
- PRNG: when called without the '-u' flag, the script will block until the
  entropy pool has been sufficiently filled. With the flag, the random input
  will be used as a seed for the pseudo-random number generator

## Usage

```
./randocat
```
